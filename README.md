# Image-Search-Abstraction-Layer
An image searcher built for the Free Code Camp backend challenge

### Minor Note:
In previous projects I used `process.env.PORT | 8080` in the app.listen (app.js) to make the app glitch.com compatible. This time it broke untill I changed it to `process.env.PORT | 3000`. If the app fails to properly start this might be the cause.
